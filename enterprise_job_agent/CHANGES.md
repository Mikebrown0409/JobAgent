# Enterprise Job Agent Changes

## March 31, 2025 - Successfully Upgraded to gemini-2.0-flash

### Implemented Changes
- Successfully migrated from Gemini Pro to gemini-2.0-flash model
- Confirmed compatibility with the test_simple.py framework
- Modified GeminiWrapper class to support the new model
- Updated test_simple.py to verify model's performance
- Documented API rate limiting support (60 RPM)
- Updated checklist.md to reflect the completed integration tasks

### Benefits
- Better complex reasoning capabilities for analyzing job applications
- Improved structured output formatting in JSON
- Enhanced context understanding for form field mapping
- Faster response times for improved application process

### Remaining Issues
- CrewAI integration still has compatibility challenges with custom LLM wrappers
- Need to investigate using direct model configuration with CrewAI instead of wrappers
- Identified integration path with Together AI as a potential alternative

## Gemini Flash 2.0 Integration Changes

### Main Improvements
- Implemented a robust Gemini Flash 2.0 wrapper for CrewAI compatibility with:
  - Enhanced message formatting optimized for Gemini
  - Rate limiting to respect the 60 RPM limit
  - Error handling and detailed logging
  - Temperature and generation parameter tuning
  
- Optimized agent prompts for Gemini Flash 2.0:
  - Restructured system prompts to use clear task-oriented format
  - Added explicit OUTPUT FORMAT sections to ensure consistent JSON responses
  - Simplified instructions to focus on key capabilities
  - Added specific guidance for handling form elements
  
- Enhanced FrameManager for more reliable form interactions:
  - Added selector caching to reduce redundant frame searches
  - Improved frame identification for stability across page reloads
  - Implemented robust dropdown dismissal handling
  - Added better error recovery for frame navigation
  
- Streamlined workflow for better reliability:
  - Removed dependency on OpenAI and Together AI
  - Improved error handling throughout the application
  - Added unique job ID tracking for better debugging
  - Enhanced result logging and reporting
