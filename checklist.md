## In Progress

- [ ] Testing integration with real job applications
- [ ] Implementing persistent knowledge storage for form patterns
- [ ] Creating feedback mechanism to learn from application outcomes

## Remaining Tasks

### System Enhancements

- [ ] Enhance error recovery with pattern-based strategies
- [ ] Add dynamic tool selection based on context
- [ ] Improve observability and monitoring
- [ ] Implement concurrent application capabilities

### Testing & Validation

- [ ] Complete testing on Discord job application
- [ ] Complete testing on Remote.com job application
- [ ] Complete testing on Allscripts job application
- [ ] Implement simulation capabilities for all major ATS platforms
- [ ] Develop performance benchmarks for Gemini integration
- [ ] Conduct A/B testing with different prompt strategies

### Production Readiness

- [ ] Enhance security measures for handling personal data
- [ ] Implement proper logging and error reporting
- [ ] Create user-friendly reporting interface
- [ ] Document system architecture and usage
- [ ] Set up deployment pipeline

## Next Priorities

1. Test with Discord job application using test mode
2. Analyze results and improve form handling
3. Test with additional job applications (Remote.com, Allscripts)
4. Implement persistent learning capabilities from test results

## Notes

* Gemini Flash 2.0 supports 60 RPM which should be sufficient for our operations
* FrameManager has been optimized with selector caching to reduce redundant frame searches
* All agent prompts have been optimized for Gemini Flash 2.0's instruction style
* Removed OpenAI and Together AI options to streamline codebase
* Added robust test mode to prevent accidental submissions
* Created comprehensive testing infrastructure with detailed reporting
